# etherna

We want to solve two big issue. One related to most part of youtube creators that in last period had been demonetized and obscured. The other one, is the preservation of user's personal data.

We are developing a new video platform, a platform free from the slavery of advertising and all its restrictions. A more transparent platform for its users. A platform in which every artist, every independent journalist and why not, companies can feel valued their creation.

Etherna will manage videos uploading them into web3.0! Technically, there is a decentralized network, based on Swarm, that receive content data. We cannot censor anything, and any uploaded video content will be always reachable with its direct link. Anyway, we will propose a purified default index of content to preserve legal stuff.

Moreover, there is no advertisement on content. We are not trying to sell you any kind of collateral product, so there is no incentive to manipulate weights on results, and in any moment, you will be able to inspect our index database, and be sure that we are not cheating.

And last but not least, if you arenâ€™t happy with our index... you will be able to open your totally independent instance, because code will be open source! On web application, there will be an option for switch our default index with another totally different, and out of our control. No problem, go and build your own index. This is freedom!

So yes, creators will be able to release their creativity and offer it to the world, final users will decide if a creator deserve to be paid.

And even if it sounds incredible, for the same amount of views, creator will gain more with Etherna than with YouTube.
With our service, we think, every people will be able to learn the real value of information.
